_I was born in the dark 90s in post-soviet Russia. My life was full of terror, total darkness, disappointment, pain and the severity of separation. However, like any Russian child._

Ok, I'm just kidding.

Born: 1994, beautiful Saint Petersburg, Russia.

Since 11 years I engaged in gymnastics (semiprofessional). Hard learned in school and studied at the Mining University (don't pay attention to the name of university).

Now I am a Linux administrator.

And yes, I don't know how to properly use all English tenses (for now) ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### Professional expertise

I have 3 years of experience as a Linux System Administrator and a Ceph Administator. Now I'm working as a Senior Linux System Administrator.

I am good operating on a Linux platforms include Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS and have good skills in research and analysis, troubleshooting, project planning, servers administration and configuration and devops. I have a great experience in implementation, configuration and maintaining of the Ceph storage system. I also have good knowledges about Microsoft Azure, AWS and its services.

Besides I know how to:
- administer web-servers (Nginx, Apache), db-servers, app-servers
- configure db-servers (Postgresql, Mysql, Mongodb, Redis)
- monitor servers (Zabbix, Collectd, Telegraf, Graphana, InfluxDB)
- automation deploy and other processes (Puppet, Ansible, Python, Bash)
- secure servers, find and test an exploits
- develop web-apps and web-sites with Django Framework (backend)

If in short, that's all. This is obvious, that I didn't try to list all my skills and technologies that I'm familiar with.

I like everything about a Linux kernel, its architecture, processes and functions, how it works. In future I would like be a C programmer, which could perform in kernel developing or something around.
